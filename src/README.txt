Object type casting is used to help convert data types.
when you need to use one data type and store it in another.
there are type of objects casting being Upcasting and down casting.
when you go from subclass to superclass that's upcasting when you go from superclass
to a subclass that's down casting.

Polymorphism is to help code be more flexible as stated in the name "many forms".
using inherited properties we can perform different task by setting up a superclass.
the superclass calls default behaviors that we then specify what these behaviors are in out subclasses.

Instanceof is used to extend Polymorphism.
its checks if an object is an instance of a specific class or subclass.
by returning true or false.

Abstraction class helps enforce a structure.
it has to be implemented by the subclasses, and they must use overrided methods
after implementing.It's used to hide details that aren't as important and highlight
what's most essential.

Interfaces contain only abstract and final variables.
methods do not need to be abstract or public because they are both by default.
same with not needing to specify being final public or static because the variables are already
set to those states.
